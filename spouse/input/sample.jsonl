Five out of the 10 that attended said they saw the article in the newspaper and turned up. \n \n\"We even had an old chap travel from Droitwich and he was late on parade by three hours. \n \n\"It's generated a lot of interest and I estimate (from other veterans who saw the article) that next month's meeting will attract about 20 people. Onwards and upwards.\" \n \nHe said the management at the pub had been extremely hospitable to them. \n \nMr Carney said: \"They bent over backwards for us. They really looked after us well. That is the best choice of venue I could have made. They even put 'reserved for the armed forces'. \n   Promoted stories   \nThe reserve veteran with the Royal Engineers wanted to go to a breakfast club but found the nearest ones were in Bromsgrove and Gloucester so he decided to set up his own, closer to home. \n \nHe was influenced by Derek Hardman who set up a breakfast club for veterans in Hull and Andy Wilson who set one up in Newcastle. He said the idea has snowballed and there were now 70 similar clubs across the country and even some in Germany. \n \nMr Carney said with many Royal British Legion clubs closing he wanted veterans and serving personnel to feel they had somewhere they could go for good grub, beer and banter to recapture the comradery of being in the forces. \n \nThe Postal Order was chosen because of its central location and its proximity to the railway station and hotels and reasonably priced food and drink. \n \nThe management of the pub have even given the veterans a designated area within the pub. \n   \n Share article  \n   \nThe next meeting is at the Postal Order on Saturday, October 3 at 10am. \n \nThe breakfast club meets on the first Saturday of each month for those who want to attend in future.","title":"Worcester breakfast club for veterans gives hunger its marching orders","media-type":"News","source":"Redditch Advertiser","published":"2015-09-07T10:16:14Z"}
{"id":"609772bc-0672-4db5-8516-4c025cfd54ca","content":"New Product Gives Marketers Access to Real Keywords, Conversions and Results Along With 13 Months of Historical Data \n\nSAN FRANCISCO, CA -- (Marketwired) -- 09\/17\/15 -- Jumpshot, a marketing analytics company that uses distinctive data sources to paint a complete picture of the online customer journey, today announced the launch of Jumpshot Elite, giving marketers insight into what their customers are doing the 99% of the time they're not on your site. For years, marketers have been unable to see what organic and paid search terms users were entering, much less tie those searches to purchases. Jumpshot not only injects that user search visibility back into the market, but also makes it possible to tie those keywords to conversions -- for any web site. \n\n\"Ever since search engines encrypted search results, marketers have been in the dark about keywords, impacting not only the insight into their own search investments, but also their ability to unearth high converting keywords for their competitors,\" said Deren Baker, CEO of Jumpshot. \"Our platform eliminates the hacks, assumptions, and guesswork that marketers are doing now and provides real data: actual searches tied to actual conversions conducted by real people with nothing inferred.\" \n\nUnlike other keyword research tools that receive data through the Adwords API or send bots to cobble together various data inputs and implied metrics, Jumpshot leverages its panel of over 115 million global consumers to analyze real search activity. As a result, Jumpshot is able to provide companies with actionable data to improve the ROI of their search marketing campaigns, SEO tactics and content marketing initiatives. \n\nAvailable today, Jumpshot Elite provides 13 months of backward-looking data as well as: \n\nAccess to real queries used by searchers \n\nPaid and organic results for any website \n\nVisibility into organic keywords, eliminating the \"not provided\" outcome in web analytics \n\nReal user queries, clicks and transactions instead of machine-generated clicks with inferred results \n\nAbility to tie keywords to real transactions on any website \n\nVariable attribution models and lookback windows \n\nLaunched in January, 2015, Jumpshot grew out of the ambitions of a group of smart marketers and data scientists who were frustrated about the limitations of the data they had access to, and excited about the opportunity to provide new insights into online behavior. \n\nThe company uses distinctive data sources to paint a complete picture of the online world for businesses, from where customers spend time online to what they do there and how they get from place to place. By tracking the online customer journey down to each click, Jumpshot reveals how and why customers arrive at purchase decisions. The company tracks more data in more detail than other services, tracking 160 billion monthly clicks generated by its extensive data panel. \n\nAbout Jumpshot \n\nJumpshot is a marketing analytics platform that reveals the entire customer journey -- from the key sources of traffic to a site, to browsing and buying behavior on any domain. With a panel of 115 million users, Jumpshot provides marketers with the insight to understand what their customers are doing the 99% of the time they're not on their own site -- a scope of information never before attainable. Jumpshot was founded in 2015 and is headquartered in San Francisco. \n\nFor more information, please visit www.jumpshot.com. \n\nImage Available: http:\/\/www2.marketwire.com\/mw\/frame_mw?attachid=2889222 \n\nKelly Mayes \n\nThe Bulleit Group \n\n615-200-8845 \n\nPublished Sep. 17, 2015 \n\nCopyright \u00a9 2015 SYS-CON Media, Inc. \u2014 All Rights Reserved. \n\nSyndicated stories and blog feeds, all rights reserved by the author.","title":"Jumpshot Gives Marketers Renewed Visibility Into Paid and Organic Keywords With Launch of Jumpshot Elite","media-type":"News","source":"Virtualization Conference & Expo","published":"2015-09-17T15:00:00Z"}

Do I still use that fairly blatant misrepresentation of my current self on my OKCupid profile? You bet I do.\u00a0 Unfortunately, a Swedish dating site called 7Heaven wants to ruin my internet game by only hosting photos of members that were taken in the last six hours. It can check timestamps. Don't even try to trick it; it's smarter than us. \u00a0 Users can upload new ones as they want to, but only if they were recently snapped. It doesn\u2019t matter who you are now \u2014 bald, chubby, with bad bangs, a bad haircut, or a new tattoo \u2014 7Heaven only wants that authentic, current self presented to potential suitors. That seems like so much work! Trying to get yourself dating-site-selfie-ready every six hours?\nAt first I thought, Chill out! How much does a person actually change in six hours? But then I remembered the disparity between how I look at work and how I look when I come home at night, take off my pants, remove my makeup, and fall asleep on the couch for a few hours before I start Tindering. Maybe six hours is too long a time period.

{"id":"ba44d0cd-bff2-4875-8036-86f37419b5e7","content":"Words kill or give life; they are usually either poison or good fruit. The words we speak are electromagnetic forces that usually reflect our inner attitude.  \n \nThey contain the power of death and life and ultimately influence the world around us. Augustus Woodbury once said, \u201cScientific men tell us that every sound upon the surface of our own and other planets circulates in endless and ceaseless waves through infinite space. Certainly not less subtle is the influence of our words upon the life and character of the world.\u201d We must always think about the influence of our words before we say them out; \u201cwhat is my objective in saying this.\u201d \u201cAre these words going to produce life or death.\u201d Proverbs 18:21 declares, \u201cDeath and life are in the power of the tongue and those who love it will eat its fruit.\u201d \n \n\nAs a matter of fact, words are our input in someone else\u2019s life. We must make sure our input gives life and not death. We are actually responsible for the impact we have on others and our communities in general. \n \nAs responsible citizens, we must intensify our awareness of the input we have on other people\u2019s lives. Actually, one person can change the course of another person\u2019s life with the power of words. Individual dreams and visions have been aborted because of words of death spoken over them. Homes and marriages have been destroyed because of poisonous words. Companies and businesses have fallen because of words of envy and jealousy. People have lost their jobs because of lying words said about them. We should always be conscious of the life-changing power of our words. \n \n\nProverbs 19:1 says, \u201cBetter is a poor person who walks in his integrity than one who is crooked in speech and is a fool.\u201d We must use wisdom when we speak, by checking our motives, attitudes and choice of words. We must divorce negative patterns of thinking and bring life to others with our words. Words are influencers. One of the best ways we can use words to influence others, is to practice telling the truth. \n \nWe are living in the world where too often people try to influence others with manipulation, false flattery and deception and spin doctoring. The truth creates trust, which in turn generates influence. The other way we can put our words to good use, is to choose to use words that build in our speech, rather than words that tear down people and society. \n \n\nWe should use our words to build other people up, to inspire, encourage and empower, to affirm and bless. Positive words yield positive influence. It is wisdom to refuse to speak words that belittle and demoralise other people around us. When we make a choice of speaking well of others, in-spite of their short comings, then we will have a healthy and far reaching positive influence with our words. \n \nIf we spread malicious gossip, we are poisoning our own future and sabotaging our own influence with others. King Solomon of ancient Israel said, \u201cWhen a leader listens to malicious gossip, all the workers get infested with evil\u201d (Proverbs 29:12, the message Bible). We must use the influence of our words to bring peace in conflicting situations. \n \n\nDue to the fact that many people have no understanding of the power of their words, they have caused themselves and others unnecessary pain and hardships. Each and every day our actions and our words impact those around us. \n \nThe question is, how are we influencing others with our words and actions? One of the best ways we can influence each other is by inspiring, motivating and encouraging each other by what we say. The story is told about how Sugar Ray Robinson changed the course of one girl\u2019s life, Flo-Jo. \n \nWhen narrating her life story Flo-Jo said, \u201cSugar Ray looked at me in the eye and told me, it doesn\u2019t matter where you come from, what the colour of your skin is, or what odds are against you. All that matters is that you have a dream and you commit yourself to that dream. Do that and it will happen.\u201d She continued and said, \u201cRight then and there, I was sold out. I was just eight years old but I was fired up about what my future could be.\u201d \n \n\nWith words, Sugar Ray Robinson, one of the outstanding boxing champs inspired a great change in one girls\u2019 life. Words are powerful, they can inspire those around us to greatness. They can bring hope to the hopeless, courage to the discouraged, comfort and healing to the oppressed. We must speak life to our husbands, wives, children, fathers, mothers, our communities and nation. \n \nPaul\u2019s wise advice to the Ephesians is appropriate at this juncture, \u201cLet no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace to the hearers.\u201d (Ephesians 4:29). By our words we can build the nation and by our words we can destroy the nation.","title":"THE INFLUENCE OF OUR WORDS","media-type":"News","source":"Times of Swaziland","published":"2015-09-28T23:21:00Z"}
{"id":"402f6983-3300-4546-82c5-6f4eb08d0ba7","content":"Just in time for the holiday shopping seasons, Apple has announced a series of hardware upgrades for the iPhone, iPad and Apple TV. iPhone's price sees steep increaseAll the Apple announcements Just in time for the holiday shopping season, Apple has announced a series of hardware upgrades for the iPhone, iPad and Apple TV. With the iPhone, the company added a feature called 3D Touch, which lets users control some of the software by exerting pressure on the touch screen. The Apple TV got its first big upgrade in more than three years with a more powerful chip and a redesigned remote control. Apple's family of iPads also gained a bigger sibling with the iPad Pro, a tablet with a 12.9-inch screen \u2014 much larger than the older 9.7-inch iPad.\n\nAt the event, I tried out the new products in a demonstration booth. Here are some first impressions: iPhone\n\nThe 3D Touch capability is the iPhone's signature new feature. Pressing down on the screen starts different actions, depending on how much force is exerted.\n\nA light press on an email, for example, shows a preview of the message, and a hard press then opens the email. You can also press down hard on an app icon to open shortcuts to different actions \u2014 for example, pushing down on the Instagram app shows a list of next steps, including the ability to create a new post. When you press down hard, the device responds with a tapping sensation.\n\nI found the new iPhones pretty straightforward to use. The 3D Touch feature is easy to get used to, and I quickly figured out how to create a new calendar appointment by pressing down hard on the calendar app icon.\n\nThe new smartphones are also slightly thicker and heavier than their predecessors, though I confess I noticed that only after reading the specifications on Apple's website and not when holding the devices. iPad\n\nThe iPad Pro's jumbo screen obviously gives more room for content to breathe, but interacting with it still feels the same as with older iPad tablets.\n\nThe iPad Pro is capable of running two full-size iPad apps on the screen at the same time. The previous iPad Air 2 could run two apps at the same time, but with a primary app taking up a larger portion of the screen.\n\nThe large device will be familiar to most because apart from its size, it works the same as previous versions of the tablet. The big-screen iPad also felt comfortable to hold. It weighs about 680 grams, which is the same weight as the very first iPad. Apple TV\n\nThe Apple TV is significantly different from past models. The software interface has a white background and vivid colours, similar to Apple's Music app. The new remote control includes a touch pad for scrolling around the menu and a microphone for finding things to watch using Siri, Apple's voice assistant. The remote also includes motion sensors for gaming.\n\nI decided to have some fun by asking Siri to help me navigate content on Apple TV. For example, I tried using Siri to steer a spaceship in a Star Wars game. But that was difficult, perhaps because of my inexperience with the game.\n\nI also tried searching for action movies and comedy movies with the remote control's microphone. Siri misunderstood me when I said \"comedy,\" thinking I had said \"comity.\" But it did a better job with action movies \u2014 when I said \"show me action movies,\" Siri brought up a list of titles including Mad Max and Furious 7.\n\nThe new remote control is thicker than the previous one, and in this case, that's a good thing. The previous Apple TV remote was so thin that it had a tendency to disappear between couch cushions.\n\nThe New York Times\n\nFollow Digital Life on Twitter The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","title":"Hands on with Apple's iPhone 6s, iPad Pro and Apple TV","media-type":"News","source":"South Coast Register","published":"2015-09-10T03:25:04Z"}

Photo: Alex Ellinghausen  \n  \nWhat will happen to her husband, long-serving Liberal Party federal director Brian Loughnane, is less clear. \n \nMs Credlin\u00a0worked for Malcolm Turnbull during his stint as\u00a0opposition leader in 2008-09, but the pair did not always see eye to eye and she will not\u00a0be\u00a0working for the incoming leader. \n\nAfter her time with Mr Turnbull, Ms Credlin became the\u00a0dominant figure in the Abbott government,\u00a0described as a controlling co-prime minister by her critics, lauded by her allies \u2014\u00a0not least Mr Abbott, who called her the \"fiercest political warrior I've ever worked with\". \u00a0As chief of staff, she became one of the most high-profile\u00a0staffers in recent political\u00a0history. \n \nFrom the first days of the Abbott opposition in December 2009, Peta Credlin was in the room as one of his most trusted lieutenants. Photo: Alex Ellinghausen  \n  \nFrom the first days of the Abbott opposition in December 2009, Ms Credlin was in the room as one of the opposition leader's most trusted lieutenants alongside press secretaries and advisers Andrew Hirst\u00a0and\u00a0Claire Kimball, honing and refining\u00a0Mr Abbott's laser-like attack on Kevin Rudd's carbon pollution reduction scheme. \n\nAfter just less than\u00a0four years in opposition,\u00a0 in September 2013, Ms Credlin, a lawyer with years of experience in the Howard government,\u00a0made the transition as chief of staff into government. \n\nBut the tightly controlled approach adopted in\u00a0opposition\u00a0did not work\u00a0as smoothly in government. \n \nMr Abbott and Ms Credlin in 2013. Photo: Alex Ellinghausen  \n  \nPublic complaints about a \" command and control \" approach taken by the prime minister's office quickly surfaced, and a reliance on slogans that worked in opposition did not cut through in government. \n\nIn February 2015, when Mr Abbott faced a spill motion in the party room, some MPs were calling for a shake-up of the prime minister's office, and for\u00a0political veteran Tony Nutt to be brought into the office. \n\nMs Credlin disappeared from public view, for a time, but the complaints soon resurfaced. \n \nBrian Loughnane has been federal director of the Liberal Party since 2003. Photo: Alex Ellinghausen  \n  \nBut Mr Abbott refused suggestions of change to his office: in his farewell speech, he\u00a0singled out his chief of staff \u00a0\"who has been unfairly maligned by people who\u00a0should've\u00a0known better\". \n\nAnd now, both exit the political centre stage, at least for a time. \n\nMr\u00a0Loughnane, meanwhile, has been federal director of the Liberal Party since February 2003 and party strategists told Fairfax Media on Tuesday that, if possible, he should continue in the role. \n\nOne veteran pointed out that Mr Turnbull and Mr Loughnane had worked together before, during Mr Turnbull's stint as opposition leader,\u00a0and that a change in director was not \"necessary or inevitable\". \n\nThat veteran also said the prime minister's office would likely benefit from a bit of \"competitive tension\" between it and Liberal Party HQ. \n\n\"It depends on the relationship between the two of them;\u00a0[Mr Loughnane] has served every\u00a0leader\u00a0since Howard.     \u00a0But Malcolm will have to be comfortable with the director \u2013 you can't have a situation like [former prime minister]\u00a0Paul Keating and [former ALP secretary] Gary Gray [in 1996].\" \n\nA second Liberal veteran said Ms Credlin was \"very talented and a good manager, but it will be hard for her to stay in the show. I do hope Brian stays on.\u00a0The most important thing is corporate knowledge and experience.\" \n\nFairfax Media sought comment from Ms Credlin and Mr Loughnane. \n\nOn Tuesday, Mr Turnbull also began the process of putting together his office team. \n\nThe former secretary of the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism, and of the Communications Department,\u00a0Drew Clarke, will serve as his\u00a0acting chief of staff, while Mr Nutt,\u00a0who worked closely with Turnbull backer Senator Arthur Sinodinos\u00a0in the office of John Howard,\u00a0will return to Canberra to help manage the transition to the prime ministership. \n\nSenator Sinodinos confirmed on Tuesday that Mr Turnbull would seek to emulate the attitude\u00a0of Mr\u00a0Howard as prime minister by taking a team approach,\u00a0\"and\u00a0have a number of senior people in there who can provide advice and make sure it's an open prime minister's office, it's accessible and that there are tributaries of advice going to the prime minister,\" he told Sky News. \n\n\"The role of the office is not to be a gatekeeper and cut people off;\u00a0the role of the office has to be a facilitator of contact so the prime minister knows and has early warning of whether there are concerns. \n\n\"You don't need the polls if you have backbenchers who are frank and willing to tell you what is going on.\" \n\nFollow James Massola on Facebook . \n\nFollow us on Twitter","title":"What will happen to Peta Credlin and Brian Loughnane, Liberal power couple?","media-type":"News","source":"Brisbane Times","published":"2015-09-15T06:04:06Z"}

I believe\u00a0our\u00a0defense is still in a state of instability and is going to be changing on the fly during\u00a0this game and week to week for a few games. \u00a0As I\u2019ve said before I think Narduzzi and Conklin\u2019s\u00a0plan for single\u00a0coverage by the cornerbacks is a problem waiting to show its face, at least in this first game. \n \nHere is what I think after reading, writing and digesting all the Pitt footballs news, notes and opinions since Pat Narduzzi signed on the dotted line: \n \nReed\u2019s Take: \n  The game will close through three quarters with both teams leading at one point.  Conner gets less than 100 yards but scores two TDs.  Passing game will be OK with more use of our TEs and Peterman will impress in his playing time.  We create\u00a0turnovers by aggressive defensive play but give up more passing (at least one big pass play) and rushing yards than we hoped\u00a0we would.  Pitt pulls away in the 4th quarter to win\u2026   \nPitt 27 \u2013 YSU 20 \u00a0 \n \nChip in with your thoughts as to what you think we\u2019ll see and what the outcome will be. \u00a0We\u2019ll take a look at our predictions on Sunday and talk about the outcome of this important game. \n \nNOTE : \u00a0We didn\u2019t get many responses for suggestions on a meeting place for the pre-game Pitt Blather\u00a0meeting.drink\/bull throwing festivities. \u00a0So I\u2019m asking you guys\u00a0to meet\u00a0at the Bettis Grill before the game. \u00a0I\u2019ll be there at around 11:30.\u00a0I\u2019ll try to get there earlier but have a friend\u2019s tailgate in Red 7 to visit also \u2013 he owes me $40 so I have to break his kneecap. \u00a0After that I\u2019ll go over to Bettis\u2019 and then leave around 12:30 or so for the press box. \n \nI can\u2019t wait to see old friends and meet some new Blather followers. \u00a0Again, check the picture out on this post\u2026 I\u2019ll be the guy with his head above almost everyone else\u2019s, a blue polo shirt with \u201cBlather\u201d on it and longer hair and a DW style mustache.","title":"2015\u2019s Opening Game Predictions","media-type":"Blog","source":"Pitt Blather","published":"2015-09-04T10:43:03Z"}

All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. \n\nAn email chain between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and then-commander of U.S. Central Command David Petraeus from January and February 2009 is raising questions about whether some of the emails on Clinton's private email server were mistakenly deemed personal and not included among the 55,000 pages of emails she turned over to the State Department. \n\nSeparately on Friday, a State Department official said a \"small number\" of Benghazi-related emails that had not been disclosed to the House committee investigating the 2012 terror attack had been discovered. \n\nIn the past few days, the State Department was contacted by the Department of Defense about the Clinton-Petraeus chain, two State Department officials said. The officials say the chain does not appear to include classified information, though an official determination has not been made. The chain included Clinton and Petraeus getting acquainted as well as some personnel matters, according to the officials. It was apparently considered personal by Clinton's team and therefore wasn't turned over to the State Department, the officials said. \n\nMost of the email chain was on an old email server Clinton says she no longer has access to, but the end of the email chain contained messages on the private server she used while in office, according to another official. The chain begins on January 10, 2009 and ends on Feb. 1, 2009 and contains less than 10 emails total between Clinton and Petraeus, the official said. \n\nState Department spokesman John Kirby said State received \"several copies of one email chain between former Secretary Clinton and then Commander of U.S. Central Command David Petraeus which were not previously in the possession of the Department\" from the Department of Defense and the State Inspector General. \"These emails are now in our possession and will be subject to Freedom of Information Act requests. Furthermore, we asked the IG to incorporate this matter into the review Secretary Kerry requested in March. We have also informed Congress of this matter.\" \n\nAlso on Friday, a State Department official also told CNN that in the process of turning over Libya-related emails to the Select Committee on Benghazi, it found a \"small number\" of Benghazi-related emails that had not been disclosed to the committee previously. These emails are among 925 Libya-related emails being turned over Friday and were found within the emails Clinton turned over to the State Department from her private server. The official said the emails were found because they have now been digitized and are easier to search. \n\nClinton turned over to State her work-related emails from the server and kept emails she deemed personal. The email server has since been turned over to the FBI, where investigators have been able to recover both the personal and work-related emails. The FBI is looking into whether any classified materials were mishandled.","title":"New Hillary Clinton email chain discovered","media-type":"News","source":"MyEastTex","published":"2015-09-26T00:10:34Z"}

He was named to the All-Star team four times in 13 seasons and helped the Cardinals win the 1982 World Series, posting a 2-0 record against the Milwaukee Brewers in the Fall Classic, including a victory in Game 7. \n\nIn 1984 and 1985, Andujar won 20 and 21 games and finished fourth in the National League Cy Young Award voting both years.

{"id":"6d899e17-59a0-4113-a86c-438ec499ac92","content":"The Texas State football team scored 63 points in its home opener. Here's the five key plays from the win. \n \n1. A new school record \n \nPrairie View A&M was trailing 27-3 with a couple seconds remaining in the first quarter, facing a 3rd-and-15 on Texas State\u2019s 43 yard-line. The Panthers punted in order to pin the Bobcats in their own territory, but their plan was foiled by Brandon McDowell, sophomore cornerback. \n \nMcDowell fielded the punt and found some space to make a play. The sophomore ran past a couple of Panthers and all of a sudden a lane opened up for him. McDowell broke some tackles, and ankles, and took the punt across the field for a 95-yard punt return for a touchdown. McDowell is behind Brandon Smith, senior wide receiver, for punt returns, but after a return like this, Smith might be looking over his shoulder. \n \n2. Second chance \n \nIt took 88 seconds for Texas State to get on the board. Another touchdown followed less than two minutes later. The opportunity was created because Damani Alexcee, junior safety, forced a fumble that Trey McGowan, senior linebacker, recovered at Texas State\u2019s 39-yard line. The fumble recovery opened up the game entirely by gifting another possession to the Bobcats. \n \n3. Back on track \n \nRobert Lowe, senior running back, scored the first touchdown of the game with 13:32 remaining in the first quarter. The touchdown was set up by a 49-yard completion to Jafus Gains, senior wide receiver, that put the team on the five-yard line. This drive set the tone for the rest of the game as Texas State showed their dominance all night over Prairie View A&M. Lowe rushed to the left side with ease and gave Texas State a 7-0 lead. \n \n4. Bowling ball \n \nOn third 3rd-and-3 in the redzone, Texas State went to Chris Nutall, senior running back. Nutall did enough to get the first down but he found more running room and took his carry into the end zone for six points. Nutall\u2019s score gave Texas State a 14-0 lead with 9:54 left in the first quarter. All hopes of an upset for Prairie View A&M were diminishing after the score. The drive was the Bobcats\u2019 second of the game and their high powered offense was on display early on in the game. \n \n5. Going long \n \nThe play started off looking like an option play with Tyler Jones, junior quarterback, but he pulled back from the option. Smith was wide-open in the secondary. The senior wide receiver hauled in the pass from Jones and the Panthers secondary was nowhere in sight. Smith took the catch for a 65-yard touchdown. The touchdown gave the team a 20-0 lead in the game. It was the first of three passing touchdowns for Jones.","title":"Five key plays from Texas State's home opener","media-type":"News","source":"University Star","published":"2015-09-13T03:36:40Z"}

Candidates\u2019 promises paints a flawless Tanzania in which no one will labour for anything. \n\nIf you critically look at things which politicians in the campaign trail promise they are going to accomplish if elected, you will be petrified. Anyone with sober mind will be horrified and left wondering on how and when these politicians are going to fulfil these pledges. \n\nIt seems also that even those who are defending their seats have forgotten that in 2010 they issued a lot of promises majority of which they have not accomplished. They now go out to dish out even more promises.\u00a0 \n\nWhile Mwalimu Nyerere used to tell Tanzanians that they will develop only through hard work, our candidates are competing to show that they have solutions to all problems and these solutions do not entail people working, let alone working hard, to resolve their problems. \n\nCandidates are promising each and everything but none of them have been heard telling Tanzanians that they will have to toil for them to earn their daily bread. \n\nMaking promises to the effect that people will not be required to work in order to better their lives amounts to making them complacent. And this will not only affect the individuals but the entire nation. For the nation to make strides it needs hard working people who will be able to first change their personal lives and then contribute for the national economy. \n\nCrave for victory should not blind the candidates and push them to give promises which in actual fact are not reasonable. We should only look back into 2010 and take stock of what was promised and what has been accomplished for us to be able to gauge what promising mean to the individuals and the nation. \n\nThe promises we have been hearing would need a lot of money to be implemented. But we are not told where this money will come from. Other candidates have started to cite natural gas as one source of money with which they will accomplish their promises. But we know that a better expert\u2019s guess is that the next leadership will leave the office before the country starts to see real money from the natural gas. So, there is no point in cheating the public that gas will provide enough money for implementation of these many plans which we are hearing. \n\nPoliticians should campaign knowing that this country or its people are not going to end tomorrow. They should practice considerate politics which respect the fact that cheating would only give them satisfaction but subject the country and its people to pointless argony. \n\nPeter Nyanje is the Political\/Election Editor of The Citizen","title":"MY TAKE ON THIS: Politicians should give us a break on empty promises","media-type":"News","source":"Tanzania Citizen","published":"2015-09-30T11:49:04Z"}

He reached speeds as high as 100 mph and deputies deemed him a threat to public safety. \n\nLt. Mitch Datillo said there is a lot for deputies to take into account before firing from a helicopter. \n\n\"If you're near schools, if you're in residential areas.

A relative of that family told Eyewitness News that he questions the decision by deputies to open fire from the air. \n\nWhile shooting from a helicopter is rare, it does happen. In 2004, a deputy with the Orange County Sheriff's Department opened fire from their helicopter on a suspect who was firing at deputies at a recycling plant near Irvine. \n\nEyewitness News spoke with use-of-force expert and Inyo County Sheriff's Deputy Ed. Obayashi, who said he agrees with the decision to shoot, based partly on the fact of the suspect's speed while heading in the wrong direction on the freeway. \n\n\"It could have been worse,\" he said. \"That constitutes an immediate grave danger to the public and that justifies deadly force.\" \n\nThe Los Angeles County Sheriff's Special Enforcement Bureau is authorized and trains deputies to shoot from a helicopter. Ventura County sheriff's deputies are not trained, but after hearing about the deadly chase, officials said they may consider changing the policy and training deputies.","title":"Sheriff's department says San...","media-type":"News","source":"LocalNews7.com","published":"2015-09-22T06:27:24Z"}

The Research and Hope Awards recognize the men and women conducting groundbreaking research, giving back to their community, advocating for patients and bringing awareness to particular diseases. This year, the awards honored those who are changing the world of oncology research and care. As we continue to gain new insight into the many variations of cancer, new tools are created, medicines are developed and new treatments emerge. With the help of dedicated individuals like the 2015 Research and Hope honorees, we move a little bit closer to transforming once-devastating diseases into manageable conditions.\n\nhttps:\/\/photos.prnewswire.com\/prnvar\/20150915\/266923\n\nThis year's recipient of the Excellence in Biopharmaceutical Research award was the KEYTRUDA Team from Merck & Co., Inc. This team developed an approved treatment for advanced melanoma and it has the potential to treat many other types of cancer. We look forward to seeing the continued development of their breakthrough work.\n\nJ. Silvio Gutkind, Ph.D., professor, Department of Pharmacology; associate director, Basic Science, Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, is this year's recipient of the award for Excellence in Academic or Governmental Research. His extensive work with G proteins ultimately led to novel strategies for treating and preventing many types of cancer. These advances have the potential to save the lives of many patients in years to come.\n\nThe Community Champion Award went to Rick Dunetz, executive director and founder of the Side-Out Foundation. Rick, a local volleyball coach, invited his mother to work with his team after her breast cancer diagnosis. She found hope in their victories and the team was inspired to win not only for themselves, but for her as well. After seeing the transformation of his mother and his team, Rick founded the Side-Out Foundation to reach other athletes and cancer patients. His work is bringing hope and energy to the cause of ending breast cancer.\n\nVicki Kennedy, co-founder and president of the Board of the ; senior counsel, Greenberg Traurig LLP, was this year's recipient of the Award for Excellence in Advocacy and Activism. Since the passing of her late husband, Senator Ted Kennedy, Mrs. Kennedy has spoken publicly on coping with stress and enhancing quality of life for brain tumor patients and their loved ones. Her dedication to telling her story, and the story of thousands of other families whose lives have been impacted by cancer is inspiring to many.\n\nThe recipients of the Visibility and Progress Award are Liz and Jay Scott, co-founders of Alex's Lemonade Stand. In 2000, their four-year-old daughter, Alex, founded Alex's Lemonade Stand to raise money to find a cure for childhood cancer after her own diagnosis. Following Alex's death in 2004, her parents set up the foundation to continue her dream of finding a cure. Since Alex's first stand in 2000, the foundation has raised more than $100 million to fund more than 475 cutting-edge research projects. Alex's spirit of determination and hope lives on through the foundations work.\n\nThese five awardees are just a few of the individuals doing outstanding work in the field of oncology research. With their dedication and our continued commitment to finding a cure, the future for cancer patients and their families looks a little bit brighter.

LOUIS , Sept. 18, 2015 \/PRNewswire\/ --\u00a0Attorneys from the Houston and Kansas City offices of the Potts Law Firm, LLP , have filed a new lawsuit against auto manufacturing giant General Motors LLC (NYSE: GM) in St. Louis City Circuit Court on behalf of 90 individual victims of a deadly ignition switch defect that led to the recall of more than 28 million GM vehicles worldwide and has caused more than 120 deaths and thousands of injuries. \n\nThe new claims for serious injuries and wrongful death follow this week's announcement that GM will pay a $900 million criminal settlement as part of a deferred prosecution agreement with U.S. Department of Justice for misleading the government and the public about the company's handling of the faulty ignition switches. \n\nThe Potts Law Firm represents hundreds of individuals and their families in lawsuits against GM in Missouri courts and other jurisdictions across the U.S. The new claims filed in St. Louis allege that the GM ignition switches caused vehicles to shut off while being driven, prevented protective airbags from inflating, and caused seatbelts to malfunction. The new filing is Patricia Foreman , et al. v. General Motors LLC . Overall, the firm represents nearly 150 ignition switch victims in St. Louis . \n\nAccomplished trial attorney and Potts Law Firm Managing Partner Derek Potts represents the families of Tabatha Rogers , 26, and Tara Yates , 27, who died in 2014 when their car unexpectedly careened off a level stretch of highway. Their case is tentatively set for trial in January 2016 in St. Louis . \n\nMs. Rogers lost control of her 2001 Pontiac Grand Am on the day after Valentine's Day on old State Highway 35 in Sevier County, Tennessee . The car hit an embankment before becoming airborne and striking a utility pole. Ms. Rogers died at the scene and Ms. Yates died shortly after at a nearby hospital. Mr. Potts says he plans to prove that a faulty GM ignition switch caused the fatal crash. \n\n\"We believe the evidence clearly shows that these young women would still be here today if not for an ignition switch that General Motors knew was defective,\" says Mr. Potts. \"It is extremely telling that airbags in their car didn't inflate at any point despite this violent, fatal wreck.\" \n\nThe Houston -based Potts Law Firm represents clients in a variety of personal injury claims and mass tort matters, from complex pharmaceutical cases to automobile defect cases to product liability claims. The firm currently is accepting new GM ignition switch cases and referrals.

{"id":"15d96c82-1705-431f-83ca-bac60a6efcf5","content":"Factional unanimity in the ALP could facilitate any move to dump Bill Shorten as leader. Source: AAP Australians woke to a new Prime Minister on Tuesday morning and feedback from opinion pollsters has been coming in thick and fast. The new incumbent, Malcolm Turnbull, is preferred by up to 70 per cent of voters according to the Morgan Poll and by a staggering 94 per cent of Coalition voters according to ReachTEL.\n\nTurnbull is opposed by a somewhat stressed Labor leader, Bill Shorten, who is supported as alternative prime minister by only 24 per cent of voters, according to Morgan, with more than a quarter of ALP voters preferring Turnbull as PM.\n\nNo wonder Shorten wants to meet Turnbull to discuss the China free-trade agreement \u2014 he\u2019s probably after a joint shot for his campaign brochure.\n\nEven more tellingly, ReachTEL shows a clear majority of Greens voters \u2014 the ones supposed to deliver 90 per cent of their prefer\u00adences to Labor \u2014 support Turnbull over Shorten.\n\nThis majority support for Turnbull from Greens voters came in a poll held after Turnbull was politically mugged on the way to Yarralumla and forced to hand control of waterways to the Nationals, a move that will cost votes for Nationals candidates at the next election, leading to more of their state and federal seats progressively being knocked off by challenges from Labor, the Greens and independents.\n\nReachTEL also estimates that the election of Turnbull as PM means the swing in Western Australia\u2019s Canning by-election today should be about minus 5 per cent, instead of the 10 per cent predicted by all polls before the leadership spill.\n\nA week ago, an upset Labor win in Canning was possible and this result would have been consistent with the seat\u2019s former position as an ALP marginal during the Hawke and Keating years.\n\nA 5 per cent swing against the Coalition would equal the personal support attracted by Canning\u2019s former Liberal MP, the late Don Randall, suggesting the Liberals effectively retained all of their party vote.\n\nThat in turn would imply the Howard battlers are firmly in the grip of the Coalition 12 months out from the next election, in Canning and comparable seats across the country, such as Lindsay in NSW or Longman in Queensland.\n\nThis conclusion is confirmed by a ReachTEL national poll showing a two-party preferred vote of 50 per cent for the Turnbull-led Coalition, with a Galaxy poll showing 51 per cent. This is an increase of 4 per cent to 5 per cent over the figures under Tony Abbott, and I suspect the Coalition\u2019s standing will improve \u00adfurther, given the former prime minister\u2019s net dissatisfaction scores and the likely positive scores for Turnbull.\n\nA rough guide to the impact of Abbott on his party vote can be obtained by dividing his net dissatisfaction scores by about five, and this corresponds to an interim sugar hit to the Coalition vote of about 6 per cent.\n\nHow long the hit lasts depends to some extent on how quickly disaffected conservatives in the Coalition stop sabotaging the new PM before he has had a chance to save their seats from their own poor judgment. It would help if Turnbull\u2019s backers stopped provoking Abbott loyalists by boasting about their hatchet job on the ousted PM as this is a story that appeals to political insiders but not to voters.\n\nCheering on yesterday\u2019s men among the conservatives is yesterday\u2019s man for the ALP, Shorten, who less than a week ago was cruising to a certain victory for Labor with about 54 per cent of the two-party preferred despite net satisfaction ratings almost as bad as those of Abbott.\n\nComplacency on the part of Labor and the timidity of its leadership left the party reliant on the visceral dislike of Abbott among key groups to insulate Labor from the Greens in the ALP\u2019s inner-city seats and to make gains in marginal urban seats, especially in Victoria and South Australia.\n\nThis strategy became redundant within 24 hours of Abbott\u2019s demise as many of the middle-class and professional voters Shorten thought were in the bag switched their support to the new Turnbull government. Now Shorten is Turnbull\u2019s greatest asset and the Prime Minister should do everything he can to ensure the Opposition Leader survives until the next election.\n\nMy profiles of elections back to 1966 make it clear that Labor gains broad-based community support when it develops credible economic and social policies for working families in provincial cities and outer suburbs, and for middle-class families in marginal urban seats. Labor has been able to build on this foundation and go on to win elections when it has chosen leaders capable of articulating these policies during an extended period of opposition and making them relevant to key groups in marginal seats.\n\nShorten\u2019s insipid leadership means Labor has done neither \u2014 and now it may be too late.\n\nThe party\u2019s first problem is the rules put in place by Kevin Rudd to protect the leader from caucus challenges. If Shorten\u2019s net satisfaction scores don\u2019t improve and the ALP\u2019s vote begins to decline towards 45 per cent, Labor will be looking to dump him as quickly and as quietly as possible. But the rule changes make it potentially harder \u2014 unless there\u2019s a complete agreement across all the factions to ignore the rules, in effect, and let the caucus get on with it.\n\nThis means a challenge could become a protracted and public fight, which would hurt Labor\u2019s vote even further. If the factions agreed Shorten had to go, his replacement would be difficult to find as the factional gene pool in the ALP is so shallow, there are no natural leaders who seem capable of dominating Turnbull in parliamentary or public debates.\n\nEven with a competent leader, Labor and the union movement have a long-running problem in rebuilding the support base they once had among skilled blue-collar men in Labor\u2019s safer urban seats and in outer urban marginals such as Canning.\n\nTo become PM you need to be able to control a majority of seats on the floor of the House of Representatives, and it helps to win more than 50 per cent of the vote, but you don\u2019t need it if you can win more than 50 per cent of the votes in more than half the seats.\n\nIf you win the votes in the right seats the swing pendulum also becomes meaningless because it\u2019s \u00adreally only a retrospective device to measure what happened and does not predict what can happen.\n\nIn 1998, the ALP needed a two-party preferred swing of about 4 per cent to win a majority of seats on the pendulum and it actually managed a swing of 5.1 per cent, yet that left it still needing a swing of 0.8 per cent to win. This is because winning votes in your opponents\u2019 key seats reshuffles the seats along the pendulum even if the swing doesn\u2019t change.\n\nJohn Howard achieved this in 1998 by winning support from traditional Labor-voting welfare recipients and skilled blue-collar tradies in seats such as Canning.\n\nProfiling of elections back to 1966 shows that the Labor vote from tradies trended downwards from 1980 and split about 50-50 between Labor and the Coalition in 2004. The tradies profile for Labor bounced back a little in 2007 and 2010, but once more split 50-50 in 2013.\n\nShould that remain the case next year, the Coalition is likely to continue to maintain a lead of about 6 per cent among men.\n\nThe decline in support for the ALP among blue-collar men during the 1980s and 90s was counterbalanced by an increase in the ALP vote among women.\n\nThe female ALP vote rose in proportion to the increase in women\u2019s workforce participation rates, which went up from 34 per cent in 1961 to 53 per cent in 1993.\n\nThe two-party preferred ALP vote among women pulled ahead of the equivalent figure for men in the early 80s, with many crossing to Labor via the Australian Democrats. The ALP\u2019s primary vote from women is now consistently about six points ahead of its primary vote from men. Politically this means that, since 2001, you would be likelier to find a safe Labor seat dominated by female clerks than by male tradies, and you would be just as likely to find a Labor seat dominated by female professionals as male tradies.\n\nThis increased participation in the workforce by clerical and professional women has had a big pay-off for unions. Just as Labor\u2019s power base became more feminised and shifted its centre of gravity from traditional outer urban seats to move closer to the goat cheese circle, so too did the power base for the union movement.\n\nWhile the proportion of male union members in the private sector continues to decline, the proportion of female union members in the public sector has remained steady, although it temporarily rose in tandem with Rudd and Wayne Swan\u2019s stimulus in 2009.\n\nPublic sector jobs in administration, education and health are keeping the union movement afloat, and these three industries in both sectors now account for 52 per cent of all union members.\n\nThese workers have been easily persuaded by their union officials to support quotas for union members in hospitals and schools, and this focus on membership growth rather than outcomes for patients and students requires a lot of public spending and commensurately higher taxes, which of course hit private sector blue-collar jobs for blokes.\n\nThis is why Labor was incapable of cutting public spending under Rudd and Julia Gillard, and why the ACTU has been desperate to secure the election of another big-spending Labor government under a weak leader who considers themselves to be dependent on union support.\n\nThe evidence, however, shows that although more than half of the extra million jobs created by Labor were in public administration, education and health, there was no political return for Rudd in 2013 in terms of bigger swings to Labor from electorates containing larger numbers of voters working in these industries.\n\nLabor\u2019s lead among female voters comes from the seats domin\u00adated by the 50 per cent of employed women in full-time jobs. They voted Labor in 2013 and swung to Labor, irrespective of their industry or union membership. The other 50 per cent of working women in the more vulnerable part-time jobs live in the aspirational middle-class seats that voted strongly for the Coalition and swung to Abbott.\n\nThese tend to be the women who temporarily have given up full-time work to have children and who are seeking to re-enter the workforce by juggling childcare and effective marginal tax rates to help pay off a family mortgage and send their children to the best school they can afford.\n\nThey have high levels of debt and spending, and they tend to cluster in similarly priced housing estates in marginal seats. They were political gold when I first profiled them in the early 70s and they are still political gold in the present undernourished Labor market.\n\nThe challenge for Turnbull in selecting his new ministry is primarily to protect his base vote among Howard battlers.\n\nHe can do this by selecting an industrial relations minister who can relate directly to blue-collar working men, and a welfare minister who doesn\u2019t poke sticks at the huge numbers of welfare recipients clustered in outer urban and provincial seats, as these voters don\u2019t consider living in relative poverty as an entitlement.\n\nTo regain a degree of parity among middle-class and professional women, Turnbull clearly needs to select more of them as members of his cabinet \u2014 including women who understand what it\u2019s like to hand over a crying toddler at the childcare centre or comb the headlice out of their four-year-old after kindy, all to pay off the mortgage, save for school fees and help provide a better life for their families.\n\nIf he can do that, balance the budget and generate 220,000 jobs a year, winning the next election against whoever is leading the ALP at the time should be a cinch.\n\nI wish him well. However you vote at present, given the state of our economy and our labour \u00admarket, we all need Turnbull to succeed.\n\nJohn Black, a former Labor senator for Queensland, is chief executive of Australian Development Strategies, a demographic profiling company.

Have you ever felt like trading in the politically correct strictures of our modern day office environment for the world of Mad Men? It still exists, apparently, if you are a Melbourne barrister.\n\nThat was the gist of a very non-PC marketing campaign by the trouble-prone financial services shop, IOOF.\n\nA male adviser at its subsidiary, Shadforth Financial Group, sent the email soliciting for financial planning business from Melbourne's barrister community.\n\nAccording to an article in Lawyers Weekly, it had a very specific idea about who our \"typical barrister\" is. Let's just say that the girls and boys have very specific roles.\n\nAccording to the article, \"After marrying their 'school sweetheart' in their 30s, he suggested barristers in their 40s are likely to find themselves in the following position \u2013 'Your wife is a 'home engineer', managing two children under 10, and you are finding the 'cottage' which was never quite finished is becoming a little crowded'.\"\n\nThings are better by the time this archetypal barrister hits his 50s. His career is established and \"your wife has gone back to part-time work and the money flow is good for a while\".\n\nThe report said several barristers had complained about this stereotype of a very male Bar with stay-at-home wives.\n\n\"Are we not thrust back to the beginnings of Mad Men?\" an anonymous QC told the publication.\n\nA Shadforth\u200b spokesperson told Lawyers Weekly: \"This does not reflect the view of Shadforth\u200b and is not the Shadforth\u200b way.\"\n\nIt won't be help Shadforth's\u200b parent, IOOF, which needs all the legal help it can get. The ASX-listed company has faced a Senate grilling, and an investigation from ASIC over allegations of front running, insider trading and faulty research reports. Degree of pain \n\nCBD would like to admit that we might have been a tad unappreciative of just what the Hawke-Keating era minister, John Dawkins, achieved during his all-too brief stint chairing education dunce, Vocation.\n\nMuch has been written about the disastrous unravelling of its business, and carnage for investors who were flogged the stock at more than $3 a pop. It is now worth 10\u00a2.\n\nGood thing they have the luxury of three different class actions at their disposal.\n\nBut they should have known better. The risks were all reported in the previous annual report signed by Dawkins, according to his replacement in the chair, Doug Halley.\n\nIn this year's report, Halley referred to last year's effort saying: \"Our annual report also referred to risks that might restrict Vocation's ability to deliver on its strategy. With hindsight, two of these risks \u2013 the company's dependence on the support of government funding, and damage to its brand \u2013 were prescient.\"\n\nThat is one way of putting it.\n\nThere is some good news for investors. The new chief executive, Stewart Cummins, said he plans new initiatives to get the company back on track like, \"build a strong management team\" and upgrade its systems \"to provide accurate management information\".\n\nWow, why didn't they think of this before the IPO in December 2013.\n\nThe most sobering information is that the company paid out a $9.5 million dividend pre IPO, and another $6.5 million in 2014.\n\nThat is $16 million in cash dividends for a company now worth $23 million. NAB's Poach \n\nASIC's national media manager, Andre Khoury, will be playing on the other side of the fence, taking up a position with NAB next month.\n\nBut NAB confirmed that he will not be working with its wealth boss, Andrew Hagger.\n\nIt is an important point given Hagger has been moonlighting for ASIC thanks to the bank's wealth fiasco.\n\nIn March this year, a Senate committee heard how Hagger has had to check no fewer than five ASIC media releases that had been sent to the bank in draft form.\n\n\"Our practice of sending media releases to external entities has been that, with a negotiated outcome \u2013 and only with a negotiated outcome such as an Enforceable Undertaking \u2013 ASIC will generally provide the party with our media release shortly ahead of publication,\" explained Khoury's current boss, Greg Medcraft\u200b. Fat loss\n\nSingaporean dotcom \"incubator\" Fatfish\u200b Group came back to the market with a Plan B on Tuesday after its investors gave it a lesson in democracy last week. They unceremoniously dumped its plan to spin-off, and list, mobile phone game maker, iCandy.\n\nFatfish\u200b said that, after consulting with iCandy's\u200b board, the ASX, and its own investors, it remains \"committed to pursuing the proposed spin-off and listing\" of iCandy\u200b.\n\nTo avoid another rejection by shareholders at the next meeting, it proposes to retain a larger stake in iCandy\u200b and distribute fewer shares to its shareholders.\n\nMind you, its investors might have been reacting to the restatement of Fatfish's accounts last week by its auditors from MSI Ragg Weir.\n\nIt appears the backdoor listing of the Fatfish business in July last year, via Atech Holdings, did not meet certain accounting standards.\n\nThis means the purchase of one particular Fatfish\u200b business should have been accounted for as a cost rather than as \"goodwill on acquisition\".\n\nThis basically doubled the company's net loss for the year ending December 31, 2014, from $6.5 million to $12.5 million. It reported revenue of $507,310 for that year.\n\nGot a tip? ckruger@fairfaxmedia.com.au The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","title":"It's a Mad world at the Melbourne Bar, as long as you're a man","media-type":"News","source":"Daily Liberal","published":"2015-09-22T14:15:00Z"}
